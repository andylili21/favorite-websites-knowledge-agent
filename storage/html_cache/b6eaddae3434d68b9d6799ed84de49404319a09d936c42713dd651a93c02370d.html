the world's most popular web server
[Netcraft];


consistently one of the most popular
Docker images
[DataDog];

Controllers for Kubernetes,
including
our own.



Enterprise distributions, commercial support and training are
available from F5, Inc.
Basic HTTP server features
 

Serving static and
index
files,
autoindexing;
open file descriptor cache;


Accelerated
reverse proxying with caching;
load balancing
and fault tolerance;


Accelerated support with caching of
FastCGI,
uwsgi,
SCGI, and
memcached
servers;
load balancing
and fault tolerance;


Modular architecture.
Filters include
gzipping,
byte ranges, chunked responses,
XSLT,
SSI,
and image
transformation filter.
Multiple SSI inclusions within a single page can be processed in
parallel if they are handled by proxied or FastCGI/uwsgi/SCGI servers;

Architecture and scalability
 

One master and several worker processes;
worker processes run under an unprivileged user;


Flexible configuration;


Reconfiguration
and upgrade of an
executable without interruption of the client servicing;


Support for
kqueue (FreeBSD 4.1+),
epoll (Linux 2.6+),
/dev/poll (Solaris 7 11/99+), event ports (Solaris 10),
select, and poll;


The support of the various kqueue features including EV_CLEAR, EV_DISABLE
(to temporarily disable events), NOTE_LOWAT, EV_EOF, number of available data,
error codes;


The support of various epoll features including
EPOLLRDHUP (Linux 2.6.17+, glibc 2.8+) and
EPOLLEXCLUSIVE (Linux 4.5+, glibc 2.24+);


sendfile (FreeBSD 3.1+, Linux 2.2+, macOS 10.5+), sendfile64 (Linux 2.4.21+),
and sendfilev (Solaris 8 7/01+) support;


File AIO
(FreeBSD 4.3+, Linux 2.6.22+);


DIRECTIO
(FreeBSD 4.4+, Linux 2.4+, Solaris 2.6+, macOS);


Accept-filters (FreeBSD 4.1+, NetBSD 5.0+) and TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT (Linux 2.4+)
support;


10,000 inactive HTTP keep-alive connections take about 2.5M memory;


Data copy operations are kept to a minimum.
